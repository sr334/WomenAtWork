# WomenAtWork
Women At Work is a website that allows women to look for how well certain companies treat their female employees. By using data from "Inhersight.com", we calculate a score for a company based on the equal opportunities for women, the number of women in top leadership positions, the management opportunities, maternity leave options, and salary satisfaction.

### Purpose
As ambitious women, we have seen the barriers to long-term job satisfaction from our peers, mentors, and role models. As we, too, begin to enter the world of employment, we see a deep need to understand the work environment for women in various industries and companies.
